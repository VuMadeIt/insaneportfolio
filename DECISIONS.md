# Decisions

Every non-trivial decision and every realism review round. Newest entries at the bottom of each
phase. Format: decision, alternatives, why.

## Phase 00 (2026-11-02)

- **Dependency versions.** Pinned exact versions published at least 7 days before the run:
  next 16.4.3 (16.4.4 was published today), react 19.3.1, three 0.186.0 (0.187.0 is 3 days old),
  @react-three/fiber 9.8.2, drei 10.7.9, gsap 3.15.0, zustand 5.0.16, tailwindcss 4.3.3,
  @playwright/test 1.64.1, leva 0.10.1.
- **TypeScript 6.0.3, not 7.x.** typescript-eslint (used by eslint-config-next) supports
  `typescript <6.1.0`; TS 7 (native port) would break lint.
- **ESLint 9.39.4, not 10.** eslint-plugin-react 7.37.5 (pulled by eslint-config-next) declares
  `eslint ^9.7` as its ceiling. ESLint 9 is marked deprecated on npm but is what the Next config
  supports today. Upgrade when eslint-config-next moves to ESLint 10.
- **Vitest 4.1.12, not 5.0.5.** npm 10.9 crashes (`Cannot read properties of null (reading
  'edgesOut')`) resolving Vitest 5.0.5's optional peer set (`@vitest/browser-playwright` resolves to
  5.1.0). Vitest 4.1.12 installs with `legacy-peer-deps`; `.npmrc` sets `legacy-peer-deps=true` so
  Vercel and fresh clones resolve the same tree.
- **Manual scaffold instead of `create-next-app`.** create-next-app would pull `next@latest`
  (16.4.4, released today) and its own template files. A hand-written scaffold matches the folder
  structure in PLAN 3.2 exactly and pins versions.
- **App Router lives at `app/` (root), everything else in `src/`.** Matches PLAN 3.2. `@/*` maps to
  `src/*`.
- **Physics import boundary is enforced by ESLint** (`no-restricted-imports` on `src/physics/**`),
  not only by convention, so acceptance test 8 has a structural guarantee.
- **Giant name size 30.5vw** (PLAN says ~20-22vw). Sam Cheng's "Sam Cheng" has nine letters;
  "Lucas Vu" has seven plus a space, so 20vw only covers ~65% of the width. The vision says edge to
  edge, so the size is derived from the width, not copied from Sam.
- **Mobile corners stack.** At < 640px the two corner lines collide, so the second line drops under
  the tagline in muted ink.
- **Screenshot script takes routes without a leading slash** (`home`, `work/shufflr`) because Git
  Bash rewrites `/foo` arguments into Windows paths.
